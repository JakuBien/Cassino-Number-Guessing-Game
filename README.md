# Cassino Number Guessing Game

## Description
This is a simulation of a classic number guessing game such as Lotto. The rules of this game are really simple.  The player is choosing 6 numbers. After he accepted his choices,
the game begins. The machine generates 6 random numbers and compares them with player ones. At the end, it gives an output of the numbers that were overlapping.

## Purpose
The whole idea of this project was to create a fun game that will help me practice object oriented programming and also problem solving.
